-- Uber Dataset Analysis in SQLiteStudio

-- Check available tables
SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table';

-- Get table structure
PRAGMA table_info(UberData);

-- Count total rides in the dataset
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total_Rides FROM UberData;

-- Find the top 10 busiest pickup locations
SELECT START AS Pickup_Location, COUNT(*) AS Ride_Count
FROM UberData
GROUP BY START
ORDER BY Ride_Count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Find the busiest drop-off locations
SELECT STOP AS Dropoff_Location, COUNT(*) AS Dropoff_Count
FROM UberData
GROUP BY STOP
ORDER BY Dropoff_Count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Calculate the average miles per ride
SELECT AVG(MILES) AS Average_Miles FROM UberData;

-- Find peak ride hours (assuming START_DATE is in a valid datetime format)
SELECT strftime('%H', START_DATE) AS Hour, COUNT(*) AS Ride_Count
FROM UberData
GROUP BY Hour
ORDER BY Ride_Count DESC;

-- Find rides per day of the week
SELECT strftime('%w', START_DATE) AS Day_of_Week, COUNT(*) AS Ride_Count
FROM UberData
GROUP BY Day_of_Week
ORDER BY Ride_Count DESC;

-- Find total miles driven
SELECT SUM(MILES) AS Total_Miles FROM UberData;

-- Find the most frequent ride categories
SELECT CATEGORY, COUNT(*) AS Category_Count
FROM UberData
GROUP BY CATEGORY
ORDER BY Category_Count DESC;

-- Find the most common trip purpose
SELECT PURPOSE, COUNT(*) AS Purpose_Count
FROM UberData
GROUP BY PURPOSE
ORDER BY Purpose_Count DESC;

-- Find the longest trip distance recorded
SELECT MAX(MILES) AS Longest_Trip FROM UberData;
